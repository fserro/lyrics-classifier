They tell us that
We lost our tails
Evolving up
From little snails
I say it's all
Just wind in sails

Are we not men?
We are Devo
Are we not men?

We're pinheads now
We are not whole
We're pinheads all

Are we not men?
We are Devo
Are we not men?
D-E-V-O

Are we not pins?
We are Devo

Monkey men all
In business suits
Teachers and critics
All dance the poot

Are we not men?
We are Devo!
Are we not men?
D-E-V-O

Are we not pins?
We are Devo
Are we not men?
D-E-V-O

All together now, God made man!
But he used the monkey to do it
Apes in the plan
We're all here to prove it
I can walk like an ape, talk like an ape, I can do what monkey do
God made man
But a monkey supplied the glue

Are we not men?
We are Devo!
Are we not men?
We are Devo!
Are we not men?
We are Devo!
Are we not men?
We are Devo!
Are we not men?
We are Devo!
Are we not men?

Are we not men?
We are Devo!
Are we not men?

Are we not men?
We are Devo!
Are we not men?
We are Devo!
Are we not men?
We are Devo!
Are we not men?
We are Devo!
