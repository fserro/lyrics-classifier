Flying Birds. 
Excellent Birds. 
Watch them fly. 
There they go. 
Falling snow. 
Excellent snow. 
Here it comes. 
Watch it fall. 
Long words. 
Excellent words. 
I can hear them now. 
This is the picture. 
I'm sitting by the window. 
Watching the snow fall. 
I'm looking out. 
And I'm moving. 
Turning in time. 
Jump up! 
And I can land on my feet. 
Look out! 
This is the picture. 
This is the picture. 
This is the picture. 
This is the picture. 
Looking out. 
I'm watching now. 
But when I see the future, I close my eyes. 
I can see it now. 
I see pictures of people rising up. 
I see pictures of people falling down. 
I see pictures of people, they're standing on their heads. 
They're ready!
