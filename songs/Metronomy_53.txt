When we were out
On the beach that night
The sun was gone
And the tide was high
And as the wind picked up you softly said
You've made a big mistake

These weeks have been everything to me
I'm a fool for her
She looks to sea "Darling, why pick me?
I'm not made for love"

You're not made for love
Well you've made a big mistake
You've made a big mistake

Now when I think of all
The things I shared
Love must have got the best of me
'Cause I fell in my place
When on the wind you said
"You've made a big mistake"

Three weeks that mean everything to me
Just flew by for her
She speaks down to me
"Darling what you think?
I'm not made for love?"
You're not made for love

Well you've made a big mistake
You've made a big mistake

Well you've made a big mistake
You've made a big mistake

Well you've made a big mistake
You've made a big mistake

When we woke up on the beach that night
When we woke up on the beach that night
When we woke up on the beach that night
When we woke up on the beach that night

When we woke up on the beach that night
The sun was gone and the tide was high
