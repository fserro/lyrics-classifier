I've been doing all the things you don't want me to do
Lay me down, sit right next to me, baby
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about you, baby

Devil barely in a dress, painting the town red
I'm watching it dry while I wait to take her to bed
I'm bored out my mind at my table paying her rent
By the time I take care of the check she be moist as a towelette
She told me she only got eyes for me
I know she ain't blind though, who she see when she got lonely?
Which one of them reached in her thighs
Birds and the bees in the hive
Trying to creep in disguise, show me
I'm only one of her one and onlys
Grass on the other side is so green
And sorry won't cut it so try a knife or don't be
While time goes slowly on the rose-gold Rollie
Fine prized ponies, all racing for dollar bills
Get your bitch a collar, chill
Chances are she probably will
Once she got all oochie-wally off a molly pill
Woke up in a Bonneville
Missed that new Bugatti feel
Roof goner than the tooth on a toddler
And the sun shining through as if it knew I'm his father
New mantras, if the goose out the bottle
I don't need no excuses for the smooch on the collar
And I don't know
If this the edge of my seat or it's the end of my rope
So whats it gonna be?
Either love or leave it alone
Asking me how I sleep at night when you know that I don't
Trying to keep from dreaming about seeing you on your own
Being who you being and leavin' me here at home
Hear the streets are speakin', I got the block in a choke
I ain't feelin' the city breathing
I'm squeezing down on its throat
Used to be a dime, now she's on the house
You made your bed now lie in it or sleep on the couch
It ain't you its me, its okay boo, I quit
It takes two to tango, but take one to dip

You never seem to tell me
What you want to be
But every time your eyes look
Down
Down
Down, oh

I've been doing all the things you don't want me to do
Lay me down, sit right next to me, baby
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about you, baby
