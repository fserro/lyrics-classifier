I went out to the insane asylum
And I saw my baby out there.
I said, "Please, come back to me, baby,
What in the world are you doing here?"
Then my old man raised up his head,
Tears were falling down from his eyes,
And these are the things

That my old man said:
"When your love has ceased to be
There is no other place for me.
If you don't hold me in your arms
I'd rather be here from now on.
Some people have it half way there,
Without your love I ain't nowhere.
I can eat and I can sleep,
I can even rest in peace.
Please take me as your slave,
And save me from that earthly grave."

Then sorrow struck my heart,
Tears began to fall down from my eyes.
The only man that I had ever loved in all my life
Out here, in a place and a condition like this.
And I began thinkin' about what my mama told me when I was a little girl.
She told me when I couldn't help myself
To get down on my knees and pray.
And I fell down on my knees

And these are the words that I said:
"Save me, save me, save me, babe,
Save me, save me, save me, dear."
Oh, I don't know just how I made it,
But I'm so glad our love is here.
