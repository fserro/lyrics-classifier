Balance in my hair, I'm pretty as f*ck
Ay, ay
Choosing what you wear
And getting this far
Tricking on my own time, what is it worth?
Got throat on my neck, neck, shatter your first
I'm waiting for the smoke to clear

Time, see it all, see all the things 

Pretty, I'm pretty as f*ck
oh oh
Choosing what you wear and getting this far
Waiting for the smoke to clear

See my tears, see it all, you've seen it all, so many times

The sun comes in
My heart fulfills within
The sun (oh, oh, oh, yes) comes in (oh, oh, oh, yes)
My heart fulfills within
The sun (the sun) comes in (comes in)
My heart fulfills within, yeah
The sun (the sun) comes in (comes in)
My heart fulfills within
The sun (the sun) comes in (comes in)
My heart fulfills within
The sun (the sun) comes in (comes in)
My heart fulfills within
The sun
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(The sun comes in)
Comes in
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
My heart fulfills within
(My heart and my soul)
The sun comes in
My heart fulfills within
