I'm goin' home, I've been gone much too long
She said she missed me since I've been gone
I'll be back soon, ain't no doubt
'Cause she said she wanted my lovin', my lovin'

No holding back I'm going home
No holding back I'm going home

I'm going stateside with my convictions
I said I'm comin' home soon, I don't know when
It'll be sometimes soon, sooner than
I thought I'd be, I thought I'd be
I thought I'd be stateside sooner than later
Marilyn inflatables, home on the range
Where the livin' is easy on a horse with no name
Kennedy convertibles, home on the range
Where the sufferin' comes easy on a blond with no brain
I'm goin' stateside
I'm goin' stateside
I'm goin' home, it's been so long
She said she missed me and all the fun we had
I think it be the best way
She said she missed me in every way

No holding back I'm going home
No holding back I'm going home

I've been gone so long
I've been gone so long
I'm missing you
Marilyn inflatables, home on the range
Where the livin' is easy on a horse with no name
Kennedy convertibles, home on the range
Where the sufferin' comes easy on a ten dollar raise
I'm going stateside
I'm going stateside
