I caught you late again
Did it to wind you up
Don't fall asleep again
I'm just arriving

Oh, oh (o-oh)
I've seen it before (before)
I had a friend who called it misunderstanding
Oh, oh (o-oh)
It's nothing at all (at all)
You and your friend
You've got a good understanding

I'll make another call
Oh, you never know
I'll make another call
Oh, you never know
Oh, we're
Planning on the long weekend
Trying to make the call again
Oh, you never know
I'll make another call
Oh, you never know
Oh, we're

Underneath the mantelpiece
Covered up in magazines
You will find the thing your heart desires
I can understand your pain
Living on your own again
It's always half-empty in your cup, fill it up now

Oh, oh (o-oh)
I've seen it before (before)
I had a friend who called it misunderstanding
Oh, oh (o-oh)
It's nothing at all (at all)
You and your friend
We've got a good understanding

We go home
We go home
When we get to my house
We go home
We go home
When we get to my house
My house, my house
We go home
We go home
When we get to my house
My house, my house
We go home
We go home
When we get to my house
My house, my house

Yeah, I love my house
My house, my house
