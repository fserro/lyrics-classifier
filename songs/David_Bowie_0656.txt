Hey baby, won't you take a chance? 
If you want to, you can have a dance 
Let's dance, let's dance 
Do the twist and shout, mashed potato too 
Any old dance that you want to do 
Let's dance, let's dance 

Hey baby, now you're all alone 
Hey baby, let me walk you home 
Let's dance, let's dance 
Do the twist and shout, mashed potato too 
Any old dance that you want to do 
Let's dance, let's dance 

Let's dance 
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues 
Let's dance 
Dance to the song they're playing on the radio 
Let's sway 
While color lights up your face 
Let's sway 
Sway through the crowd to an empty space 

If you say run, I'll run with you 
If you say hide, we'll hide 
Watch my love for you 
It would break my heart in two 
If you should fall into my arms 
And tremble like a flower 

Let's dance 
Let's dance 
Let's dance, let's dance 
Let's dance, let's dance
