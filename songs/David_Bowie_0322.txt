I give a little into the moment 
Like I'm standing at the edge, I know
That no one's gonna turn me around
Just one more step, I could let go
Oh and in the middle
I hear the voices and they're calling for me now, I know
That nothing's gonna wake me now
'Cause I'm a slave to the sound

And they're calling
Don't stop, no, I'll never give up
And I'll never look back, just hold your head up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough
They keep saying
Don't stop, no one's ever enough
I'll never look back, never give up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough
Oh, but now I'm falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling, falling, oh

Now we're going down
And I can feel the eyes are watching us so closely, oh
I'm trying not to make a sound
'Cause I'll be found out somehow

So keep calling
Don't stop, no, I'll never give up
And I'll never look back, just hold your head up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough
They keep saying
Don't stop, no one's ever enough
I'll never look back, never give up
And if it gets rough, it's time to get rough
Oh, but now I'm falling

Into the fire feeling higher than the truth
(I'm falling)
I can feel the heat but I'm not burning
(But now I'm falling)
Fear and desire feed the tired, hungry tooth
(I'm falling)
Feels like I'm falling, yeah
I can hear them calling
(But now I'm falling)

Into the fire feeling higher than the truth
(I'm falling)
I can feel the heat but I'm not burning
(But now I'm falling)
Fear and desire feed the tired, hungry tooth
(I'm falling)
Feels like I'm falling, yeah
I can hear them calling
(But now I'm falling)

Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling, oh
And now I'm falling

Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling
Falling, falling, falling, oh
(But now I'm)

Falling, falling, falling, falling
Fall, yeah
But now I'm
Falling, falling, falling, falling
Fall, yeah
Oh, but now I'm falling

Into the fire feeling higher than the truth
(But now I'm falling)
I can feel the heat but I'm not burning
(I'm falling)
Fear and desire feed the tired, hungry tooth
(But now I'm falling)
Feels like I'm falling, yeah
I can hear them calling for me (falling)

Into the fire feeling higher than the truth
(But now I'm falling)
I can feel the heat but I'm not burning
(I'm falling)
Fear and desire feed the tired, hungry tooth
(But now I'm falling)
It feels like I'm falling, yeah
I can hear them calling for me
