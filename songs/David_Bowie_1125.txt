Oh
Oooh yeah
Ah
Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with weird and gilly
And the spiders from mars. he played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man, then we were ziggy's band

Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from japan, he could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
They came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders while the fly tried to break our balls
Just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands?

Oh
Ooh oh

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass, he was the naz
With god given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar

Making love with his ego ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man i had to break up the band.

Oh yeah
Ooh
Ziggy played guitar
