Hey, hey it's the tall sail on a beach, reach for Java
Make way for to Java watching for Boogies
Hey, hey, it's a dreaming, I would burn you if you should die
Hey, hey, I should burn too if you should lie upon that bamboo pyre

I dream of Amlapura, never saw in all my life a more shining jewel
I dream of Amlapura, of an ocean or dream of a princess in stone

Hey, hey, golden roses around a rajah's mouth
Hey, hey, all the dead children buried standing
A flying dutchman, smoking gun and spice wind

I dream of Amlapura, never saw in all my life a more shining jewel
I dream of Amlapura, of an ocean or dream of a princess in stone
