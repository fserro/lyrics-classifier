Nobody calls
Fall into pieces
Don't be afraid
Life isn't easy
Sunshine to rain
Counting the windows

And nobody calls
Nobody calls
Sunshine to rain
Smile for the camera

But nobody phones
Nobody phones 
Anyone
At all

Not at all
Not at all
Not at all

Nobody phones 
Anyone
At all
Nobody phones 
Anyone
At all
Nobody phones 
Anyone
At all
Nobody phones 
Anyone
At all

Not at all
Not at all
