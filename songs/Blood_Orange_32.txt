You chose to fade away with him
I chose to try and let you in
You chose to fade away with him
I chose to try and let you in

Making life just feel fine
Dreaming of a life of staying in

You chose to fade away with him
I chose to try and let you in
You chose to fade away with him
I chose to try and let you in

Begging, begging for your everything
But everything is something
Something that is true
Begging, begging for your everything
But everything is something
Something that is true, true

You chose to fade away with him
I chose to try and let you in
You chose to fade away with him
I chose to try and let you in

Silence on my estate
