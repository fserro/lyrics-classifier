Hearing is getting me down
Is getting me down to the disco floor
Hearing is wearing me down
It's wearing down from my ears

All those evenings
Spent disappointed on dancefloors
All led to now and learned one day

I wanna get more from this
I wanna get more from this
I wanna get more from this than you

Sometimes I'll put up with it, alright
But I can't even dance the way I might
Were it just me and you tonight

I wanna get more from this
I wanna get more from this
I wanna get more from this
I wanna get more from this, than you
