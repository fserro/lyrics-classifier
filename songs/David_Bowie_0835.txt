Telling lies

Gorgeous girls are bound to meet
To talk of stars and kings and feet
Through the chromosomes of space and time

Me, I'm fast like bad infection
Gasping for my resurrection
Swear to me in times of war and stress

Telling lies, telling lies
Telling lies, telling lies

Telling lies
(Oo, ah, missionary, oo, ah, visionary)
Telling lies
(Feels like something's gonna happen this year)

Telling lies
(Oo, ah, missionary, oo, ah, visionary)
Telling lies
(Feels like something's gonna happen this year)

Telling lies

Shadow falls on shrinking smiles
See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all that's pure

Come straggling in your tattered raiments
Come to me in tears and blame
I'm your future, I'm tomorrow, I'm the end

Telling lies, telling lies
Telling lies, telling lies

Telling lies
(Oo, ah, missionary, oo, ah, visionary)
Telling lies
(Feels like something's gonna happen this year)

Telling lies
(Oo, ah, missionary, oo, ah, visionary)
Telling lies
(Feels like something's gonna happen this year)

Telling lies
Telling lies

Oo, ah, oh
Oo, ah, oh
Oo, ah, oh
Feels like something's gonna happen this year

Oo, ah
(Telling lies)
Feels like something's gonna happen this year
Oo, ah
(Telling lies)
Feels like something's gonna happen this year

Oo, ah
(Telling lies)
Oo, ah
Oo, ah
(Telling lies)
Feels like something's gonna happen this year
