It was the last weekend of september
I stayed up all night long
Waiting for the fire ache in my heart to subside
It never happened
He was the most beautiful boy I'd ever seen
Most beautiful boy I'd ever met
My favorite books
Around the clock scars of my knee
I see him behind my lids in a bright grey shirt
I see him tripping running and falling, covered in dirt
I see a lot of these things lately I know
I know none of it is real

It's in the way that he moves
But I don't want to choose
Another day and I'll lose
But I don't want to choose, oh

Oh
Face to the ground
Change the sound
Time in your mind
Make it right

It's in the way that he moves
But I don't want to choose
Another day and I'll lose
But I don't want to choose, oh

Oh
Face to the ground
Change the sound
Time in your mind
Make it right

Baby, let me take you home
It's in the way that he moves
Baby, let me take you home
But I don't want to choose
Baby, let me take you home
Oh
Yeah
Baby, let me take you home
Another day and I'll lose
Baby, let me take you home
But I don't want to choose
Baby, let me take you home
Oh, oh
Oh
