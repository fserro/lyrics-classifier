(Hey, it ain't over)
Me, I hope that I'm crazy
I feel you driving and you're only the wheel
Slow down, let someone love you
Oh, I've never touched you since I started to feel
If there's nothing to hide me
Then you've never seen me hanging naked and wired
Somebody lied, I say it's hip
To be alive

Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to win
All you've got to do is win
That's all you gotta do (ooh, it ain't over)

Me, I'm fresh on your pages 
Secret thinker sometimes listening aloud
Life lies dumb on its heroes
Wear your wound with honor, make someone proud
Someone like you should not be allowed
To start any fires

Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to win
All you've got to do is win
That's all you gotta do (ooh, it ain't over)

Now your smile is spreading thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to win
All you've got to do is win
That's all you gotta do (all you got to do is win)

Now your smile is spreading thin (seek and believe in you)
Seems you're trying not to lose (it ain't over, no no)
Since I'm not supposed to grin (that's all you got to do)
All you've got to do is win (it ain't over, no, oh)
(Seek and believe in you)
All you've got to do is win (it ain't over, no, no)
Woo hooh, all you've got
Is all you've got
(It ain't over)
It ain't over
