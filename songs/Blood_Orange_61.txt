Follow me under and never feel weak, too unique
To feel interruption, get your heart in line, you're starting to feel weak
Maybe a thing that you wanted is all you need
Don't it fill your expectation, better luck with thoughts that you conceive

Promises, promises, promises left that you know
Changing it better
Promises, promises, promises left that you know
Changing it better

Follow me under and never feel weak, too unique
To feel interruption, get your heart in line, you're starting to feel weak
Maybe a thing that you wanted is all you need
