I saw my baby, crying hard as babe could cry
What could I do? 
My baby's love had gone
And left my baby blue
Nobody knew

What kind of magic spell to use
Slime and snails
Or puppy dog tails? 
Thunder or lightning
Then baby said
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)

Put that baby's spell on me
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)
Put that magic jump on me
Slap that baby, make him free
