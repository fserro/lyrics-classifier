Cash girls suffer me
I've got no enemies
I'm walking down

It's nothing to me
It's nothing to see
If I'll never see the English evergreens I'm running to
It's nothing to me
It's nothing to see

I'm dying to
Push their backs against the grain
And fool them all again and again
I'm trying to
We bitches tear our magazines
Those oligarchs with foaming mouths from now and then
Can't believe I just run second, now I'm forgetting you
I'm trying to
I'm dying to

Dollar days, survival sex
Honor sketching tails to necks
I'm falling down
It's nothing to me
It's nothing to see
If I'll never see the English evergreens I'm running to
It's nothing to me
It's nothing to see

I'm dying to
Push their backs against the grain
And fool them all again and again
I'm trying to
It's all gone wrong for on and on
The bitter nerve is never enough, I'm falling down
Don't believe for just one second I'm forgetting you
I'm trying to
I'm dying to

I'm trying to
I'm dying to

I'm trying to
I'm dying to

I'm trying to
I'm dying to

I'm trying to
I'm dying to
