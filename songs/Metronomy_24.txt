Just one fight and just one anniversary
So I never thought you'd be the one to up and leave
You said our love was written in the stars
But I never paid attention to my charms

And now I see how quick you must want to forget
'Cause you left the ring I bought you with your cigarettes
Well I can finish up if you don't want them
And I can take the ring back where I got it from

I can love it or
I can leave it
You said honey, I
Best be leaving
'Cause you're a novice and
I'm a Taurus and
I'm not gonna say
I'm not gonna do

Yeah, I can love it or
I can leave it
You said honey, I
Best be leaving
'Cause you're a Taurus and
I'm Aquarius and
I'm not gonna say
I'm not gonna do

Never thought about it sentimentally
Never saw just how much you thought I meant to me
Never learned about it in university
Never thought about it 'cause you're the first to see

And I'm aware of the procedure
But normally it's me that leaves her
I guess I'm finished up
It's time to move on
I'm taking the ring back to where I got it from

I can love it or
I can leave it
You said honey, I
Best be leaving
'Cause you're a novice and
I'm a Taurus and
I'm not gonna say
I'm not gonna do

I can love it or
I can leave it
You said honey, I
Best be leaving
'Cause you're a novice and
I'm a Taurus and
We've had problems, we're
Notorious for them
It's what your friends said, now
You're inside there, now
I've seen our stars but there's
Nothing aligning.
'Cause I'm Aquarius
Yeah, I'm Aquarius

I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
I'm Aquarius
