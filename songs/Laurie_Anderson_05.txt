What's this? 
A little dust in my eye
Well I'm not the type to cry
It's four a.m. 
I'm standing by the bed where you lie
Sleeping the sleep of the newborn
I put my finger to your lips. 
Warm air.
Five a.m. 
You lift your hand and open it.
Then you slipped away. 
You slipped away.
Oh death, that creep, that crooked jerk
He comes, he comes walking. 
He comes sneaking
Down that long irreversible hallway
Grabs you in your sleep
I walk outside to the parking lot.
Bright coins of water on the sidewalk.
Big white building where your body lies
Stands in the middle of the fields. 
Icy air.
And after all the shocks the way the heart unlocks
And ooo we slip away. 
We slip away.
I'm thinking about the way that lost things always come back
Looking like something else
A fishing pole, a shoe, an old shirt, a lucky day
Oh then they slip away into the remains of the day
Oh they slip away. 
They slip away.
I'm thinking how you taught me how to win
And how to loose
And how to fight the crippling blues that I was born with
Bad dreams and nightmares
Oh they slip away. 
Oh they slip away into the remains of the day.
I know that sometime I'll stop looking for you.
Stop seeing your face every day
Bad dreams and nightmares and big bad wolves
Oh they slip away into the remains of the day
Oh they slip away into the remains of the day
They slip away
You told me you had no idea how to die but I saw
The way the light left your eyes
And after all the shocks the way the heart unlocks
And oh then you slipped away. 
You slipped away.
