Follow that sea
Chase what you know
Cover your your weave
Jump in the fall

Yo, yeah, yo
Uh, uh, uh
Is this the way that you want it to end?
Is this the way that you leave me?
I already told you I don't wanna be friends
What's it gonna take for you to believe me?
Is this the way that you want it to end?
Is this the way that you leave me?
Is this the way that you want to pretend?
Is this the way that you see me?

Is this the way that you, way that you are? (Yeah, bring hope when you come around)
Is this the way that you, way that you are? (Yeah, I still smile when you come around)
Yeah, I still smile when I come around
Is this the way that you, way that you are? (Yeah, bring hope when you come around)

Is this the way that you leave me? (Yo, yo, yeah, bring hope when you come around)

Yeah, I still smile when you come around
Yeah

What's it like where you are from?
Are you just a heart attack
Buy one up and make it your home
Apparitions of your love
Have you seen them falling short

Is this the way that you, way that you are? (Yeah, bring hope when you come around)
Is this the way that you, way that you are? (Yeah, I still smile when you come around)
Yeah, bring hope when you come around
Is this the way that you, way that you are? (Yeah, I still smile when I come around)
Is this the way that you, way that you are? (Yeah, bring hope when you come around)

Is this the way that you leave me? (Yeah, I still smile when I come around)

Yeah, I bring hope
I bring hope, yeah
I bring hope, yeah
I bring hope, yeah
Bring hope when you come around

Yeah, gee I don't
Sometimes I ask myself, like
You know, what is going to take for me not be afraid
To be loved the way, like, I really wanna be loved
But that I know how I really wanna be loved
But I'm, but I'm, like, scared to really, really feel that
You know, it's like you want something but you don't know if you can handle it

Don't let me in
You are the only one
You give me that hope that, um you know (Don't look again)
Maybe one day I'll get over my fears and I'll receive (You'll be the only one)
You'll be the only one (Follow that sea)

Chase what you know
Cover your weave
Jump in the fall
Follow that sea
Chase what you know (You'll be the only one)
Cover your weave
Jump in the fall
