As soon as you`re born they make you feel small
By giving you no time instead of it all
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school
They hate you if your clever and they despise a fool
Till you`re so fucking crazy you can`t fallow their rules
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
When they`ve tortured and scared you for 20 odd years
Ah then they expect you to pick a career
When you can`t really function you`re so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
Keep you doped wit religion and sex and TV
And you think you`re so clever and classless and free
But you`re still fucking peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
There`s room at the top they are telling you still
But first you must smile as you kill
But if you want to be like the folks on the hill
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
Just follow me
