Forget everybody's name
Summer loving's had its day
Let's go out and celebrate, oh oh
We could never get enough
And what I said was super dumb
Let's go out and have some fun, oh oh

I see something's not right
'Cause you left your friends outside
Hanging off of everyone
Holding onto each other's arms
So let's take this home again
Let's do it tonight
Nothing is impossible
When we're in each other's arms

Well I gave up when summer came around
'Cause she could never tell when I was down
Then every night and every single day
I said I'm okay
Yeah I'm okay baby
I swear I'm okay
I swear I'm okay baby
Even though my heart aches
My heart aches

Even though my heart aches
Even though my heart aches
My heart aches, my heart aches

Love, honey
