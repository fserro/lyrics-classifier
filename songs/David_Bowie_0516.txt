No more delight or crawling around
Whisper the word hold my hand
Never forget those who refuse you
Never forget who you've been
And you will fight with demons
And we shall go to town
And we'll eat between the rich men
And we'll dream if we don't go down

Follow the lights stay on the outside
The only way in is swollen with tears
Don't bring your things just let me serve you
Only fool turns around
And you will fight with demons
And we shall go to town
And you will wear your best shoes
And we'll dance if we don't go down
And we'll dance if we don't go down
