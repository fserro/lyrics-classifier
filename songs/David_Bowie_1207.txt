This week has past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
There's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If you would stay here tonight
That would be crazy tonight

Stay, that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so badly this time
'Cause you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something you want too

Heartwrecker, heartwrecker, save me tonight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

Stay, that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so badly this time
'Cause you can never really tell when somebody
Wants so much to stay
That's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is stay this time
I really meant to so badly this time
'Cause you can never really tell when somebody
Wants something you want too

Stay
