VERSE 1
  New angels of promise
  We despair
  We are the dead dreams
  We take the blame
  Take us to the edge of time
  Take us to the edge of time
  We are the fabulous lovers
  I am a blind man
  She is my eyes

CHORUS (x2)
  Suspicious minds
  You didn't feel us coming in this lonely crowd
  It's always time

VERSE 2
  New angels of promise
  We despise
  Don't fall apart now
  We are the silent ones

  Take us to the edge of time
  Take us to the edge of time
  We are the tabular lovers
  We listen to the strorm

CHORUS (x2)

VERSE 1

CHORUS (x2)

It's always time (repeat)
