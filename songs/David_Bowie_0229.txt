As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest she was, Todd Browning beast you was

Crawling down the alley on your hands and knees
I'm sure you're not protected for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground, they will, mannequins with kill appeal

(Will they come)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come)
Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come)
Well, she's come, been and gone

Come out of the garden, baby
I'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, call him a Diamond Dogs
Young girl, call him a Diamond Dogs

Now Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevators broke so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, go Tarzie, go man, go

Meets his sweetest little hussy with his ghost town approach
His face is sans feature but she wears a diamond broach
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to wear
Wrecked up and paralyzed, Diamond Dogs are sable-ized

(Will they come)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come)
Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come)
Well, she's come, been and gone

Come out of the garden, baby
I'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, call him a Diamond Dogs
Young girl, call him a Diamond Dogs

Call him a Diamond Dog
Call him a Diamond Dog

In the year of the scavenger, the season of the witch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lovely little kitch
There's gonna be sorrow, try and wake tomorrow

(Will they come)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come)
Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come)
Well, she's come, been and gone

Come out of the garden, baby
I'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, call him a Diamond Dogs
Young girl, call him a Diamond Dogs

Call him a Diamond Dog
Call him a Diamond Dog
Call him a Diamond Dog
