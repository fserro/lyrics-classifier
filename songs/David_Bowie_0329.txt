There's a brand new dance
But I don't know its name
That people from bad homes
Do again and again

It's big and it's bland
Full of tension and fear
They do it over there
But we don't do it here

Fashion, turn to the left
Fashion, turn to the right
Fashion

We are the goon squad
And we're coming to town

Listen to me, don't listen to me
Talk to me, don't talk to me
Dance with me, don't dance with me, no

There's a brand new talk
But it's not very clear
That people from good homes
Are talking this year
Fashion

It's loud and tasteless
And I've heard it before
You shout it while you're dancing
On the ole dance floor
Fashion

Fashion, turn to the left
Fashion, right
Fashion

We are the goon squad
And we're coming to town

Listen to me, don't listen to me
Talk to me, don't talk to me
Dance with me, don't dance with me, no
