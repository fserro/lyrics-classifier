With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you
Was sorrow, sorrow

You're acting funny, try to spend my money
You out there playing your high class games
Of sorrow, sorrow

You never do what you know you ought to
Something tells me you're the devil's daughter
Sorrow, sorrow

I tried to find her cause I can't resist her
I never knew just how much I missed her
Sorrow, sorrow

With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you
Was sorrow, sorrow

With your long blond hair, I couldn't sleep last night
With your long blond hair
