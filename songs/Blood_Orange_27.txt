Come on, let me take you down, oh
Come on, let me make you 'round, oh
Come on, let me love ya
Come on, let me love ya
Come on, let me love ya
Come on, let me take you down, oh
Come on, let me make you 'round, oh
Come on, let me love ya
Come on, let me love ya
Come on, let me love ya
Come on, let me love ya

Tell me how you wanna
Swim with me in deep water
Fly away to the sky
And dry me with your fire

Come on, let me take you down, oh
Come on, let me make you 'round, oh
Come on, let me love ya
Come on, let me love ya
Come on, let me love ya
