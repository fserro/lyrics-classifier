He changed his vibe, take back at five
My crew went live, your crew can't vibe
My eyes, they burn red, my bag stays in bed
Cash out, I'm on tint, brick out in L-E-S
Smoke less and feel blessed, feel blessed when undressed
Undress to think less, think less, I'm obsessed
Obsessed and still stressed, still stressed and smoke less (yeah)
Yes (yes, yes)

Take out the trash and go
I don't need you no more
And I know that you're scared of what I
Can do to you 'cause you never knew
Mm, the power I possess (yeah)
You can't take this stress
'Cause you know it could get too deep (too deep, yeah, yeah)
So just stick with me now

Changed his vibe, take back at five (oh)
My crew went live, your crew can't vibe (hurt you)
Just stick with me now
Cash out, I'm on tint, brick out in L-E-S
Smoke less and feel blessed, feel blessed when undressed

And if you let me take you down
It won't get too deep, get too deep
If you let me take you around town
Just stick with me
'Cause you know I could teach you lessons you ain't never heard before
So just stick with me
If you know what's good for you, baby
You will let me teach you a little something
If you know what's good for you, baby, baby
Said if you know what's good for you
