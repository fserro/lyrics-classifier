People living their lives for you on TV
They say they're better than you and you agree
He says, "Hold my calls from behind those cold brick walls"
Says, "Come here, boy, there ain't nothing for free"
Another doctor's bill, a lawyer's bill
Another cute cheap thrill
You know you love him if you put in your will but

Who will save your souls when it comes to the powers now?
Who, who will save your souls after all the lies that you told, boy?
And who will save your souls if you won't save your own?
La di-di-da, di-da, di-da-da, da-la-da

We try to hustle them, try to bustle them, try to cuss 'em
The cops want someone to bust down on Orleans Avenue
Another day, another dollar, another war, another tower
Went up where the homeless had their homes
So we pray to as many different Gods as there are flowers
But we call religion our friend
We're so worried about saving our souls
Afraid that God will take His toll
That we forget to begin but

Who will save your souls when it comes to the babies now?
Who, who will save your souls after those lies that you told, boy?
And who will save your souls if you won't save your own?
La di-di-da, di-da, di-da-da, da-la-da

Some are walking, some are talking, some are stalking their kill
Got social security but it doesn't pay your bills
There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay
So you bargain with the devil, but you're okay for today, say
That you love them, take their money and run
Say it's been swell, sweetheart, but it was just one of those things
Those flings, those strings you've got to cut
So get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts

Who will save your souls when it comes to the babies now?
Who, who will save your souls after those lies that you told, boy
And who will save your souls if you won't save your own?
