This is not America
Shalalalala

A little piece of you,
The little piece in me,
Will die
(this is not a miracle)
For this is not America

Blossom fails to bloom this season,
Promise not to stare,
Too long
(this is not America)
For this is not the miracle

There was a time,
A storm that blew, so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

For this is not America

Shalalalala
Shalalalala
Shalalalala

This is not America (No)
This is not
Shalalalala

Snowman melting from the inside
Falcon spirals to,
The ground
(this could be the biggest sky)
So bloody red, tomorrow's clouds

A little piece of you,
The little piece in me
Will die
(this could be a miracle)
For this is not America

There was a time,
A wind that blew, so young
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

For this is not America

Shalalalala
Shalalalala
Shalalalala

This is not America (No)
This is not,
Shalalalala
This is not America (No)
This is not,
Shalalalala
This is not America (No)
This is not,
Shalalalala
