I do what I wanna do when I wanna do it
Bitch, I got the bags to prove it
Hips to move it around and make shapes, yes
Trim the waste off and the waist down girl it's lift off
It's french tips wrapped 'round a dick
Do you want a taste?
I don't give a f*ck what you think
You don't know me
You might owe me
But bitch you'll never know me
Ask me how I got here
Bitch, I worked hard
Ask me about my luck
Yeah I've been lucky
And I've been unlucky
It's both
Don't put your shit on me
Bitch, I'm special you can't tell me otherwise
That'd be a lie

Who do you think I am?
It's not who do you think you're dealing with, no
'Cause you're not dealing with
There's no deal
Bitch it's real on my side
Go ahead, speak for yourself
Go ahead, speak for yourself
Cast the first stone
If you wanna be a puppet
Better yet

Speak for your self, states
Speak for your self, states
Speak for your self, states
Speak for your self, states
Speak for your self, self, states
(I'm over your) Self, states
Speak for your self, states
Speak for your self, states
Speak for your self, states
(I'm over your) Self

I can be friendly or I can be fake
I can be real or I can lick a taste
What's it gonna take?
I can be sexy or I could be sad
And bad just to be sweet, what a treat
It is to be
Nonbinary, ma ch√©rie
Tee hee, bitch
