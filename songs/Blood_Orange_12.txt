How will you know when life will choose to fade away?
How will you know if you've been wrong?
Pull it down and show you've taken all that fades
Know it'll take too long

And it seems like it's unnatural to stay
I say I'm holdin' on
Would you notice (would you notice)
If I wrote you something?

Happiness will fade
Happiness will fade
Happiness will fade
Happiness will fade

And it seems like it's unnatural to stay
I say I'm holdin' on, uh, uh
Would you notice (would you notice)
If I wrote you something?

Happiness will fade
Happiness will fade
Happiness will fade
Happiness will fade
