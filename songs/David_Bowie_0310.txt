Got to use her

Every time I feel fascination
I just can't stand still, I've got to use her
Every time I think of what you pulled me through, dear
Fascination moves sweeping near me
Still I take ya

(Fascination) fascination
(Sure 'nuff) fascination
(Takes a part of me) takes a part of me
(Can a heart beat) can a heart beat
(Live in a fever) live in a fever? 
(Raging inside of me?)
(Fascination) fascination
(Oh, yeah) oh yeah
(Takes a part of me) takes a part of me
(I can't help it) I can't help it
(I've got to use her) got to use her
(Every time, ooh)
Fascination comes around
(Ooh, oo, ooh)

(Fascination) your soul is calling
Like when I'm walking
Seems that everywhere I turn
I hope you're waiting for me
I know that people think
That I'm a little crazy
Ohh, better sex is fun
I think I like fascination
Still, tick

(Fascination) fascination
(Sure 'nuff) ooh
(Takes a part of me) come on, come on, come on, come on
(Can a heart beat) can a heart beat
(Live in a fever) live in a fever? 
(Raging inside of me?)
(Fascination) fascination
(Oh, yeah) oh yeah
(Takes a part of me) come on, come on
(I can't help it) I can't help it
(I've got to use her) got to use her
(Every time, ooh) every time
Fascination comes around
(Ooh, oo, ooh)

(Fascination) sure 'nuff
(Sure 'nuff) takes a part of me
(Takes a part of me) can a heartbeat
(Can a heart beat) live in a fever
(Live in a fever) raging
(Raging inside of me?) fascination
(Fascination) fascination
(Oh, yeah) fascination
(Takes a part of me) fascination takes a part of me
(I can't help it) fascination

Come around (ooh, oo, ooh) come around

Raging inside of me, fascination, yeah yeah
Oh yeah (fascination), fascination, yeah yeah
