Yeah, I hear wedding bells
But they're not for you
They're for your best friend
And for my best friend

Yeah, I hear wedding bells
But they're not for me
They're for my best friend
And your best friend

Yeah, I hear wedding bells
Yeah, I hear wedding bells
Yeah, I hear wedding bells
Yeah, I hear wedding bells
But they're not for you

My guitar
My guitar
My guitar
My guitar

So, let's hideout
Yeah, let's hideout
Yeah, let's hideout
Yeah, let's hideout

So, let's hideout
In the darkness
Of your parent's
Back garden

'Cause I hear wedding bells
Yeah, I hear wedding bells
Yeah, I hear wedding bells
Yeah, I hear wedding bells
But they're not for you
