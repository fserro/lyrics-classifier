I see you runnin' out the window
Brain is runnin' like it's hidin' from the night
Think of somethin', I'm feelin' real (I think it)
Brain is runnin' like it's runnin' from the night

I wanna see you
And keep it in your home
I wanna see you (I wanna see you, ooh)
And keep it in your home
I wanna see you (I wanna see you)
And keep it in your home (ooh)
I wanna see you
And keep it in your home
And keep it in your home
