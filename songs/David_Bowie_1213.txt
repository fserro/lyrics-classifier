Your turn to drive
Thick as a line
Out of your mind
You need the time
You're sweet and you're tired
Watching the line
Watching the line
You're making my songs
You're making my heart
Your turn to drive
It's all in the songs
It's all in your mind

Your turn to drive
Drive tonight
I'm high tonight
You gotta drive, drive
Your turn tonight
Turn tonight
Turn tonight

Your turn to drive
You're making my songs
You're making my heart
Your turn to drive
As thick as the line
Out of my mind

Your turn to drive
Drive tonight
I'm high tonight
Drive, drive
You gotta drive tonight
High tonight
Drive tonight
