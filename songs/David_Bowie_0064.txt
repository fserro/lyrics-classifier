Beauty shrieks, "Beast in the booties."
Comin' home so lay the table
Look at you callin' shots
Call you over, under out
I was under, backwards, forwards
Holding hands in the dark
Kissing some, kissing cousins
Kissing this

[Chorus:]
You can't talk
You can't see me drowning
You can't talk
I don't see you swimming
You can't talk
You want go your way
You can't talk

I know you don't blow me
Look at us hearts-a-poppin'
Guess it's over
Crazy action mine's a breakin'
Guess it's over here we go

[Chorus]

Beauty shrieks, "Beast in booties."
Comin' home so lay the table
Look at you callin' shots
Call you over, under, out

[Chorus]
