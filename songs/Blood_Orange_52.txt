.19s, but I keep a plain though
Leather inside, dark-tinted window
Wood-grain wheel, tell me how you really feel
Ride past all the kids, yellin' out, "Bingo"
Talk a good game, Trey Wingo
Speak in code so nobody know the lingo
Life like a dice game, ain't no casino
Street life, contra, ain't no cheat code
Everyday on the line like a free throw
Shit weak, like the knees on D. Rose
I was taught, "Look out for your people"
Meet Heaven and you gotta know evil
Heart of a lion, eye of a eagle
Life a movie, but ain't no sequel
Switch lanes in that new thing
Got on that red line while I'm playing Flock of Seagulls
So no way we could ever be equal
In the hay stack, I was that needle
Hold it in, thinkin' no one will believe you
Lose it all in a second, like Me Too
The whole world is evil
Gun shots echo, never be peaceful
Smokin' diesel to forget it all
If I don't do nothin', I'ma ball

Ayy (ayy), gotta get what's mine
Ayy (ayy), before I lose my mind
Ayy (ayy), like I'm runnin' out of time
Ayy (ayy), shine light, man, shine (shine)

Break down, lock down, run up on 'em all (nothing that you used to)
Down on the corner, if you see me, I'ma ball
Break down, lock down, run up on 'em all (nothing I can pass to walk alone)
Down on the corner, if you see me, I'ma ball
Break down, lock down, run up on 'em all (shinin' on myself, so)
Down on the corner, if you see me, I'ma ball
Break down, lock down, run up on 'em all (nothing can break down the simple floor)
Down on the corner, if you see me, I'ma ball

Ayy, gotta ball 'till you fall
Ain't a system of design, one strike take it all
Ayy, all it take, one call
Pray you lose it all, one second, all gone
Ayy, know you feelin' all alone
But who can you turn to when things gon' wrong?
Ayy, it's the plot all along
Push you down the wrong path, the statistics have shown
Everything that I known turned out to be lies
Found out when I was grown so I shed that light
On these dark undertones, had a nigga head gone
Why they buy the diamonds and the car with shiny chrome?
My fault, all alone in the scheme of it all
Play like a bong, had to stay strong
Got my head above water, had to keep movin' on
Had my head above water, had to keep movin' on

Ayy (ayy), gotta get what's mine
Ayy (ayy), before I lose my mind
Ayy (ayy), like I'm runnin' out of time
Ayy (ayy), shine light, man, shine (shine)

Break down, lock down, run up on 'em all (nothing that you used to)
Down on the corner, if you see me, I'ma ball
Break down, lock down, run up on 'em all (nothing I can pass to walk alone)
Down on the corner, if you see me, I'ma ball
Break down, lock down, run up on 'em all (shinin' on myself, so)
Down on the corner, if you see me, I'ma ball
Break down, lock down, run up on 'em all (nothing can break down the simple floor)
Down on the corner, if you see me, I'ma ball

The dream is realized, my heart skips a beat
I'm tyin' my feet, the baby can't sleep
Defeat the sun, reach, the furthest relax
The weed is uncertain, why men attacked
Facts is unlocked, dress is untied
Mind could explode, time to cut ties
