Tell me if you caught my lie
My heart's not true
Tell me if we're on the line
Are we through?
Tell me if you're in my life
Don't go
Baby, are we on the line?
Are we through?

Baby, are we on the line?
Tell me baby, are you mine?
Is our love on the line?
Tell me baby, are you mine?
Look and tell me what I'd find
Tell me baby, are you mine?

My heart's not true
Are we through? Oh
Don't go
Are we through? Oh
Tell me if you caught my lie
Oh
Tell me if we're on the line
Are we through? Oh
Tell me if you're in my life
Don't go
Baby, are we on the line?

Baby, are we on the line?
Tell me baby, are you mine?
Is our love on the line?
Tell me baby, are you mine?
Look and tell me what I'd find
Tell me baby, are you mine?
Tell me baby, are you mine?
Tell me baby, are you mine?

So baby, is it all you got?
Baby, are we on the line?
So baby, is it all you got?
Tell me baby, are you mine?
So baby, is it all you got?
Is our love on the line?
So baby, is it all you got?
Tell me baby, are you mine?
So baby, is it all you got?
Look and tell me what I'd find
So baby, is it all you got?
Tell me baby, are you mine?
So baby, is it all you got?
