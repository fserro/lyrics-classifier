You're out on the ocean and you get pulled down
Freefall to the bottom
Like when you're drowning or falling asleep
You get turned around
And when you think you're swimming to the surface
You're swimming straight down.
Down to the bottom. All the way to the bottom.

Secret codes and cryptograms
I'm lost in your words I'm swimming.
We're going down to the bottom. All the way to the bottom.
Rapture of the deep.

I got your letter. I couldn't read it. It was a cryptogram.
Did it say Take me with you or Take me as I am?
We're going down to the bottom. 
All the way to the bottom. We get turned around.
There is another world spinning inside of this one.

I remember where I came from
There were tropical breezes and a wide open sea
I remember my childhood
I remember being free.

Down to the bottom. 
All the way to the bottom. We get turned around.
There is another world inside of this one.
Rapture of the deep.

We're going down to the bottom.
There is another world spinning inside of this one.
