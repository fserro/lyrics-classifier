Ooh

Started smirking, Mr. Broken
Thoughts awoken, in the night
Such a force, exchange my thought
Change, we're tired, f*ck that
Take it back, drinkin' that gin
Said it stands for all I lack
where's my brother, moving backwards
Falling deeper on my classics
Make a statement, I lost my way
I used to say where I'm heading
Anyway, f*ck that
Take it back, (take it back) f*ck that
I take it back, (take it back) f*ck that
I take it back, (oh-oh, that) f*ck that
I take it back, (I just take it back) f*ck that
Yeah (but f*ck that)
(Mm, but f*ck that)

I've been fucked so the odds aren't even
It's time for freedom
Put us right back
All for you

Vente para acá
Que ya no quiero esperar más a que me llames
Un día cualquiera en que te vi
Tu me has cachao'
No hay otra manera de decirlo
Tu me has cachao'
Papi, como tu no tienes idea

Started smirking, Mr. Broken (me has cachao')
Thoughts awoken, in the night (de una manera)
Such a force, exchange my thought
Change, we're tired, f*ck that
Take it back, drinkin' that gin
Said it stands for all I am

The skies remain broken, you can't take back a bullet
That shit will see right through it, one shot to make it through it
See, I'm a bit manic-depressive, glad I didn't do it
If not for you I would've, you and your family knew it
See, we were both born different, science can't weigh the spirit
I wish I called sooner, guess that's my smoking gun
Discovered intuition with you aside an institution
Like you, I pick my truth, not sure what you believed in
But through you I saw me different, in you I found solution
What's clear as day is dark as night, I cannot see shit
Back out with all my demons, blacked out for all my reasons
My reflected image vanished in a instant
