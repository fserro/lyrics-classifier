I've been watching my money
Save, saving up for a holiday
A week in Paris, a trip to Rome
I can't afford to go on my own

So you want me to yourself
Well, you must know that won't happen
So you want me to yourself
Well, you must know that won't happen

I've [Incomprehensible] my bikini
For my holiday

We won't go to Paris
It's full of things that you like too much
We won't go to Germany
It's full of girls that you like to touch

We won't go to Paris
It's full of things that you like too much
We won't go to Germany
It's full of girls that you like to touch

So you want me to yourself
Well, you must know that won't happen
So you want me to yourself
Well, you must know that won't happen

So you want me to yourself
Well, you must know that won't happen
So you want me to yourself
Well, you must know that won't happen
