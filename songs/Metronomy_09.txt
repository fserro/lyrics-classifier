I used to play drums in
I used to play drums in a rock 'n roll band
But they kicked me out
'Cause I used to feel it
And so I would speed up

I wrote off my dad's car
I wrote off my dad's car on my way home
I wrapped it 'round a tree
On a corner I've taken so many times
I wrote off my dad's car
I wrote off my dad's car, unfortunately
I wrapped it 'round a tree
On a corner I take way too confidently

I used to play drums in
I used to play drums in a rock 'n roll band
But they kicked me out
'Cause I used to feel it
And so I would speed up

I used to play drums in
I used to play drums in a rock 'n roll band
But they kicked me out
'Cause I used to feel it
And so I would speed up

I've upset my girlfriend
But she doesn't know that I'm gonna propose
I fired out a text
But she doesn't answer
God, it's a disaster

I used to play drums in
I used to play drums in a rock 'n roll band
But they kicked me out
'Cause I used to feel it
And so I would speed up

I used to play drums in
I used to play drums in a rock 'n roll band
But they kicked me out
'Cause I used to feel it
And so I would speed up

I used to play drums in
