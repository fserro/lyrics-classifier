No one can blame you for walking away
But too much rejection, uh-huh
No love injection, nothing

Life can be easy 
It's not always swell
Don't tell me truth hurts, little girl
'Cause it hurts like hell

But down in the underground
You'll find someone true
Down in the underground
A land serene, a crystal moon 

A-ha

It's only forever
Not long at all
Lost and lonely
That's underground, underground

Daddy, daddy, get me out of here (heard about a place today)
Ha, ha, I'm underground (nothing ever hurts again)
(Nothing ever hurts again) well, I found a place
(Daddy, get me out of here) nothing ever hurts again
(Hoping for the underground) down and down and get me out of here
(Hoping for the underground) ha, ha, I'm underground
(Get me underground) sister, sister, please take me down
Ha, ha, I'm underground (gotta get me out of here)
Daddy, daddy get me out

No one can blame you for walking away
But too much rejection, uh-huh
No love injection, nothing

But down in the underground
You'll find someone true
Down in the underground
A land serene, a crystal moon 

A-ha

It's only
It's only forever
It's not long at all
They're lost and they're lonely
That's underground, underground

Daddy, daddy get me out
Heard about a place today (heard about a place today)
Nothing ever hurts again (nothing ever hurts again)
Daddy, daddy get me out of here (daddy, get me out of here)
Ha, ha, underground (hoping for the underground)
Sister, sister, please (hoping for the underground)
Ha, ha, I'm underground (get me underground)
Daddy, daddy, get me out

Under, under
Under, underground
Underground
Under, underground
Under, underground
Under, underground
Wanna live underground
Wanna live underground
Daddy, daddy, get me out of here
Ha, ha, underground
Sister, sister, please take me out of here
Ha, ha, I'm underground
Ha, ha, I'm underground
Ha, ha, underground
Daddy, daddy, please
Daddy, daddy, please
Wanna move underground
Wanna move underground
Sister, sister, take me too
Sister, sister, take me too
