I don't want knowledge 
I want certainty
I don't want knowledge 
I want certainty
I don't want knowledge 
I want certainty

In the street a man shouts out loud
A wallet drops and money flies 
Into the midday sun
With the sound, with the sound 
With the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound 
With the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound 
With the sound of the ground

Oh I get a little bit 
Afraid sometimes
Earthlings on fire 
Earthlings on fire

With the sound, with the sound 
With the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound 
With the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound 
With the sound of the ground

Sure I get a little bit 
Afraid sometimes

Earthlings on fire 
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire
Earthlings on fire

I don't want knowledge 
I want certainty
I don't want knowledge
I want certainty

In a house a man drops dead
As he hits the floor he sighs
What a morning

With the sound, with the sound 
With the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound 
With the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound 
With the sound of the ground

With the sound, with the sound 
With the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound 
With the sound of the ground
With the sound, with the sound 
With the sound of the ground

Sometimes earthlings on fire 
I don't want knowledge
I want certainty
Oh I get a little bit 
Afraid sometimes
I don't want knowledge 
I want certainty
I don't want knowledge 
I want certainty 
Oh I get a little bit 
Afraid sometimes
