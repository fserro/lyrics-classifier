(Since I saw you last there's been many a sunset)
(And every day we're apart seems like a week)
(Oh, but I know you would love to hear when we first met)
(But every day we're apart seems like a week)

Since I saw you last there's been many a sunset
(You don't need to break it)
And every day we're apart seems like a week
(Gold is all you see)
Oh, but I know you would love to hear when we first met
(I don't even understand)
Every day were apart seems like a week

Draped in monotony
What's my life gotten me?
Hard to be glorious when two minds meet in the corner
And a story is being told
By me to you, take another hit, what else to do?
Think about leaving the house
But my fears aren't letting up

We'll always love you but, that's not my fault
We'll always love you but, that's not the point
(It's all our fault, and and it's on me you're in pain)
We always loved you

(We'll always love you but, that's not the point)
Night time, I'm fine dreaming of another life
Night time, I'm fine dreaming of another life
Night time, I'm fine dreaming of another life
(We'll always love you but, that's not the point)
Night time on fire dreaming of another life
Night time, I'm fine dreaming of another life
Night time, I'm fine dreaming of another life
Night time, I'm fine dreaming of another life
