It's the darkest hour, you're twenty-two
The voice of youth, the hour of dread
The darkest hour and your voice is new
Love is lost, lost is love

Your country's new
Your friends are new
Your house and even your eyes are new
Your maid is new and your accent too
But your fear is as old as the world

Oh, what have you done?

Say goodbye to the thrills of life
Where love was good, no love was bad
Wave goodbye to the life without pain
Say hello, you're a beautiful girl

Say hello to the lunatic men (say hello, hello)
Tell them your secrets 
They're like the grave (tell them all you know)
Oh, what have you done? 
Oh, what have you done? (They're just like the grave)
Love is lost, lost is love (love is lost)

You know so much, it's making you cry (you know, you know)
You refuse to talk but you think like mad (you know, you know)
You've cut out your soul and the face of thought (you know, you know)
Oh, what have you done? 
Oh, what have you done?

Oh, what have you done? 
Oh, what have you done?

What have you done?

What have you done?
