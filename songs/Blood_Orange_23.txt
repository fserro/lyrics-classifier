My father was a young man
My mother off the boat
My eyes were fresh at twenty-one
Bruised but still afloat

Our heads have hit the pavement
Many times before
You stroke his face to soothe him
While knowing that there's more

Saint Augustine
Late have I loved and chose to see (what did I choose to see?)
Skin on his skin
A warmth that I can feel with him

And no one even told me
The way that you should feel
Tell me did you lose your son?
Tell me did you lose your love?
Cry and burst my deafness, while Trayvon falls asleep
The things that I can't do to you
The things that I can't do to you

Saint Augustine
Late have I loved and chose to see (what I chose to see, what I)
Skin on his skin
A warmth that I can feel with him

We heard it all from you (we heard it all from you)

We waited here for you (waited here for you)
