This is not America
Shala la la la

A little piece of you
The little peace in me
Will die
For this is not America

Blossom fails to bloom this season
Promise not to stare
Too long
For this is not a miracle

There was a time
A storm that blew so pure
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

For this is not America
This is not America
This is not

Snowman melting from the inside
Falcon spirals
To the ground
So bloody red tomorrows clouds

A little piece of you
The little piece in me
Will die
For this is not America

There was a time
A wind that blew so young
For this could be the biggest sky
And I could have the faintest idea

For this is not America
This is not America
This is not

This is not America
This is not
This is not America
This is not
