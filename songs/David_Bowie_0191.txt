White boys falling on the fires of night
  (I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
Flesh punks burning in their glue
Revolution comes in the strangest way
  (I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
I'd rather be inside you

CHORUS1 (twice)
  Tell the truth
  Tell the truth
  Tell the truth
  We prick you we prick you we prick you

CHORUS2 (twice)
  You show respect even if you disagree
  You show respect

Mama can I kiss you daddy can I tell
  (we wish you well, we wish you well)
Innocence passed me by
want to be screwing when the nightmare comes
  (I wish you well, I wish you well)
want to come quick then die

CHORUS1 (twice)

All the little rose-kissed foxy girls
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
Where have all the flowers gone
All the little fragile champion boys
Toys, toys, little black toys
Dripping on the end of a gun 

Even if you disagree

CHORUS1 (twice)

CHORUS2 (twice)

Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
  (even if you disagree, even if you disagree)
Toys, toys, little black toys
Wish you well, wish you well

Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
Wish you well, wish you well
