Dreaming Orlando (get it)
Give it time
Walked these steps before
Sixteen and old
Confusing knowing that it's different
He wants to give in
After school, set the books down
Darling, out
First kiss was the floor

First kiss was the floor
But God it won't make a difference if you don't get up
Tell me the song, song

I don't know, turn the lights on
What they want me to think
But I'm changing the state
All that I know was taught to me young
Seen it all before

First kiss, the floor
First kiss, the floor
First kiss, the floor

Shoot, baby, shoot

Live for the floor

You know, it's an insult we often put onto a lot of folk is, like
Oh, you're doing too much
So like, a couple years ago I was like
You know what, my resolution, my eternal resolution will be to do too much
Yes, I love it
