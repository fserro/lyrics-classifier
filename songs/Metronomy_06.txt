Help me please
Help me be the one
Show me please
How I can be the one

'Cause I understand
That I hold you back
But I'm just a man
A bad one at that

So I'll hold it down
And I'll give you up
'Cause I understand
That you're not in love

Yeah, I'm going to be alright
I see the light
So I'm going to be alright
Yeah, I'm gonna be alright

Help me feel
Help me feel alright
Bury me
Bury me alive

'Cause I understand
That I hold you back
But I'm just a man
A bad one at that

So I'll hold it down
And I'll give you up
'Cause I understand
That you're not in love

'Cause I understand
That I hold you back
But I'm just a man
A bad one at that

So I'll hold it down
And I'll give you up
'Cause I understand
That you're not in love

Yeah, I'm going be alright
I see the light
So I'm going to be alright
I see the light
Yeah I'm going to be alright
(Be alright, be alright, be alright, be alright)
(I'm gonna be alright, gonna be alright)
(Gonna be alright-right, be alright, be alright)
(I'm gonna be alright)
