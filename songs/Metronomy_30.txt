He's got the most immaculate haircut
But with the right dye and shampoo, maybe I could too

And he's got the most desirable friendship group
But boy when you got that hairdo, they're not gonna call you

Now we got to get together and make some amends
I see the girls falling for you, oh she must adore you woah
Woah
Woah
Woah

I get this feeling in my bones
Sometimes it's like my legs might fall away
A shooting pain runs down my left hand side and I
I think of you

Oh hush now
Don't have a baby
Look at what you gave me
We can always grow, you know
Oh hush now
Don't have a baby
Look at what you gave me
We can always grow together

I get this feeling in my bones
Sometimes it's like my legs might fall away
A shooting pain runs down my left hand side and I
I think of you

Oh hush now
Don't have a baby
Look at what you gave me
We can always grow, you know
Oh hush now
Don't have a baby
Look at what you gave me
We can always grow, you know
Oh hush now
Oh hush now
Oh hush now
Oh hush now
