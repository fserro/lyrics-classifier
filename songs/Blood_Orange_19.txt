My man Rico MDB in the house
My dog Z man with the chain
My dog TC over here, grillin' on gold, extended comma, grease rod

Lookin' for the truth, for the truth
Tell me what you want from me (Lookin' for the truth, for the truth)
Lookin' for the truth, for the truth
Tell me what you want from me (Lookin' for the truth, for the truth)
Lookin' for the truth, for the truth
Tell me what you want from me (Lookin' for the truth, for the truth)
Lookin' for the truth, for the truth
Tell me what you want from me (Lookin' for the truth)

Switchin' up your style, but you've waited too long
Finally answer now so, it's wrong
Pacing yourself from wasting yourself in the name of truth
But what's true?
Brother, baby, we've seen it all
And we're tired, so what you want from me? (Lookin' for the truth, for the truth)

Tell me what you want from me (Lookin' for the truth, for the truth)
Lookin' for the truth, for the truth
Tell me what you want from me (Lookin' for the truth, for the truth)
Lookin' for the truth, for the truth
Tell me what you want from me (Lookin' for the truth, for the truth)
Lookin' for the truth, for the truth
Tell me what you want from me (Lookin' for the truth, for the truth)

Nothing can replace me if you're not taking my lead
Better to be broken than in need, uh
Brother, baby, we've seen it all
And we're tired, uh, so what you want from me? (What you want from me?)

Tell me what you want from me (what you want from me, baby)
Tell me what you want from me (yeah)
Tell me what you want from me
Tell me what you want from me (with the cameras on, woo)

Lookin' for the tube, for the job
Blowin' like the time, word to Mob
Shawty told me that this world is ours
Selfish with that pussy like it's mine
Peppermint, devil mint, spearmint, type a
She the type of chick to get right on the dick
Ride on the dick, with no lights switchin' it up
No relatives, sentimental
It's detrimental, could compare to this relevance
She the type of chick to get right on the dick
Ride on the dick, with no lights switchin' it up
Back and forth, wall to wall, use the jaw
Lose the drawers
In the sauce now
On the job
Never off, that pussy got
Won't let her off, and it's so good
Shout out my ex, though
She was the best, though
Got on my damn nerves
Hella fresh, though
I bought baggish shirts, she had a men's shirt
I turn it to a sweatshirt, throw on that Sweatshirt
She f*ck with Earl, too
She f*ck with girls, too
I f*ck with her too
Tell her quit the chattin', jaws made for chewin'
And if you fuckin' with me, best know what you're doin', like

(F*ck that, get the new CD, feel me before they kill me
Feel me before they kill me, you heard me?)

Pat hard
I like it dirty dirty
Been known to beat it, beat it
Tell her lies and I promise a whole lotta shit
She ain't never get it
You never let me in
Or no miffy nigga bitch, hands they were slick
F*ck that can of beans
In the city, babe
The whole mogul rich
I got pretty cake
She treat it like she do
'Cause she pretty fake
Women hate
I got chocos call me pretty Drake
