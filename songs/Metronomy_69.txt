When I first saw you boy the other night
Checking out my girlfriends
Hanging with your boyfriends
I have to say that you were looking tight
I was checking out your dancing
Hoping that my luck was in
Won't you turn around
Have a look at what you're missing
Maybe we can do some kissing

Darling if you saw my treats
You'd fly so high you couldn't catch your feet
And baby when you look so sweet
You need some of my trick or treatz
Trick or treatz
Trick or treatz

why don't you come here boy just step to me
I'm expecting nothing fancy
yeah I just want you to romance me
I'm not concerned by rims or the way you drive
I just want you to impress me
see how quick you can undress me

Darling if you saw my treats
You'd fly so high you couldn't catch your feet
And baby when you look so sweet
You need some of my trick or treatz
Trick or treatz
Trick or treatz
