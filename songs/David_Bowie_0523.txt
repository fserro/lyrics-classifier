5:15, I'm changing trains
This little town, let me down
This foreign rain, brings me down

5:15, train overdue
Angels have gone, no ticket
I'm jumping tracks, I'm changing time

We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore only you

5:15, all of my life
Angels have gone
I'm changing trains

Angels like them, thin on the ground
All of my life, all legs and wings
Swings turn the eyes

5:15, train overdue
Angels have gone

We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore only you

Cold station all of my life
Forever I fear [Incomprehensible]
