Just when I'm ready to throw in my hand
Just when the best things in life are gone
I look into your eyes, uh, uh

There's no smoke without fire, uh, uh
You're exactly who I want to be with, uh, uh
Without you
What would I do

And when I'm willing to call it a day
Just when I won't take another chance
I hold your hand, uh, uh
There's no smoke without fire, uh, uh
Woman I love you, uh, uh
Without you
What would I do
