When I take you back 
I thought you'd only up and run
But you're still here, I know

And when I take you back
I thought you'd only up and run
But you're still here 
You're still here

And now everything goes my way
And now everything goes my way 
It feels so good to have you back my love
I'm in love again (love again)
Love, I'm in love again (love again)

I'd given up on you
You shot a hole in my heart straight through
When you pushed me aside, three weeks I cried

But now you've got me back 
You know I'll never up and run
Yeah I stay I'll here 
I'll stay right here

And now everything goes my way
And now everything goes my way 
It feels so good to have you back my love
I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again

Love, I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
Love, I'm in love again
