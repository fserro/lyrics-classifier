For when she heard the explosion
Her eyes grew wet and wild
She raced through the streets of Birmingham
Callin' for her child (hey, yeah)
She clawed through bits of glass and brick (oh)
And lifted out her shoe
Oh, here's the shoe my baby wore
But baby, where are you? (Baby, where are you?)

Oh, baby, oh
My baby, where are you? (Woo)
My (where are you?)
My baby, oh, oh
My baby, my baby where are you?
Oh, my baby
Oh, my baby (uh)
My baby, my baby where are you?
