I can't read and I can't write down
I don't know a book from countdown
I don't know which shadow gets me

All I've got is someone's face

Can I see the family smile?
Can I reach tomorrow?
Can I walk a missing mile?
Can I feel?
Can I please?

I can't reach it anymore
I just sit back and ignore
I just can't seem to get it right
I can't reach it, I can't reach it

Money goes to money heaven
Bodies go to body hell
I sit back and catch the chase
Switch the channel, watch the police car

I can't reach it anymore
I just sit back and ignore
I just can't seem to get it right, get it right
I can't reach it, I can't reach it
