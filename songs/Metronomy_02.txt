I've got an insecurity
I get it when you're here with me
I take it 'cause I'm being a man
But I think it might be killing me

I've got an insecurity
Gets real bad when you're next to me
I take it 'cause I'm being a man
But I swear that it is killing me

What is love?
What is hurt?
What is she saying?

Let's get it back
Who is he?
I could be the one who's playing

I'll take it 'cause I'm being a man
What is love?
Oh, oh, oh

I've got an insecurity
Gets real bad when you're next to me
I take it 'cause I'm being a man
But I swear that it is killing me

What is love?
What is hurt?
What is she saying?

Let's get it back
Who is he?
I could be the one who's playing

I'll take it 'cause I'm being a man

What is love?
Oh, oh, oh

And I hate what it has done to me
Yeah, I hate what it has done to me
It's building up inside of me
Oh baby, baby can't you see?

What is love?
Oh, oh, oh
