Lie down it off
F*ck around it off
Frown upside down it off
Slide around it off
(Can you feel it in your skin)

Share the goodness of mercy, shall follow me
Every day of my life, yeah
Share the goodness of mercy, shall follow me, yeah
Every day of my life

Make it hot in Summertime, it's messing with my eyes
Time flies when the kush is burnin' in your eyes
Black skin, white tie, baby came alive
Just in time to recognize your faded alibi
Who will listen when you call? Nobody picks up
Young man, dark tan, blinds tied shut
Pure, clean, dominant, try your luck

When I felt it in my hand
Just like I remembered it
Then I got away from it
Yeah, just for a little bit
Take a piece out of the tin
Cut a corner off of it
(Then I got away from it) bye, bye
Bye, bye
Bye, bye
