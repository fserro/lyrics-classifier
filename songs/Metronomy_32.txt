Never wanted, never needed 
You said honey, best be leaving 
If you want, I'll pack a bag 
Foreign money, in your hand 
In your hand baby

Tube of tooth paste, facial cleanser
Bar of soap and moisturizer

But it gets better 
But it gets better

Never wanted, never needed 
You said honey, how you feeling? 
Hotel pillows, worth a try 
If you want me, swing on by 
Swing on by baby

Mini bar with, many choices 
Bedside table, distant voices

But it gets better 
But it gets better

Does it get better?
Does it get better?
Does it get better?

Never wanted, never needed 
You said honey, best be leaving 
If you want, I'll pack a bag 
Foreign money, in your hand 
In your hand baby
