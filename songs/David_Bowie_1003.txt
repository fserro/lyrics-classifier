Wish I were a sailor crossing an azure sea
Under leaden skies, under your eyes
But I can't see too far with these animal eyes
Can't hold my breath without your voice

An' I'm danger-prone, I'll be bound
I'll be fast as hell without your touch
An' I'll run, run, run, run, run
An' I'll run, run, run, run, run without your love

I'm a Goldman, I'm a soaring tower
And it's cold in here without your love
Trouble in here, trouble out there
Mainline problems 'til you no longer care

Get a long-low life, it's duty bound
No hope, no life, no you, aha
And I run, run, run, run, run, run
Without your love

I duck the shots, tilt the world
I talk myself crazy, shoot the breeze
Shout to live, shoot to kill
Double up in pain, I'm on my knees
