Too hot for the night
I'm loose, can't even act right
Two shots and a guy my height
Real talk, that's rude
I forget you don't know that I move like this
Lowkey, real shady

Girl like me on a flex daily
It's a lot, it's a lot
When I'm in my mind
Do I look bad breed
'Cause I ain't got time
No feelings, no exclusive
Your chick knows
I come through ruthless
Come through with your chest
Don't gas
You a baddy doing bits
Or you wet like the rest?

I-I'm too hot but I might
But, but, I might
I-I'm too hot but I might
But, but, I might
