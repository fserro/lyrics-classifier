Hey babe, what's happening? How are you doing?
We can make it babe
Me and you, me and you, me and you

It wasn't really
It wasn't really
It wasn't really much at all
It wasn't really

So, it's summertime, a splash of wine
And forget about it
If you're so inclined, let's take a ride tonight
So then maybe if the stars align
We'll fix our minds on another tangent
And it's kinda like impossible to top this at all

Giving me life and it's everything
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
Feeling myself like I'm Norma Jeane
Here in my arms is where you should be

It wasn't really
It wasn't really much
It wasn't really much at all
It wasn't really
It wasn't really
It wasn't really much at all

My philosophy doesn't quite apply to you and me
But I won't think too much
So c'mon and feel my touch
It wasn't really much at all
Just a little sensitivity of the soul
Here in my heart is where you should be
Oh you are

Giving me life and it's everything
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
Living like Babs 'cause it's Evergreen
Here in my arms is where you should be

It wasn't really
It wasn't really much
It wasn't really much at all
(It really wasn't) it wasn't really
It wasn't really
It wasn't really much at all

Whats up ma? Hush got fly
Here's a ques', why you left, was it my messed up eye?
Why? Reminisce wanna be huncy hun
Follow sheep, from was the first chick, Clarks Wallabees on
Swag honey drip, spending some time
Remember them rhymes? Your gold fronts look better than mines did
What's ecstasy, pounding in the BM'
Cloud a million, that was way before war, gowns in the skier
Giving me life

Giving me life and it's everything (Mariah Carey)
Thinkin' bout' when we were seventeen
Feeling myself like I'm Norma Jeane
Here in my arms is where you should be

Giving me life and it's everything (giving me life)
(Everything yeah)
Thinkin' bout' when we were seventeen (thinkin' bout' when we were)
Living like Babs 'cause it's Evergreen 9'cause it's Evergreen)
Here in my arms is where you should be (oh you are)

Giving me life and it's everything (wasn't really, wasn't really)
Thinkin' bout' when we were seventeen (got me thinkin' bout' whene we were)
Feeling myself like I'm Norma Jeane (wasn't really, wasn't really)
Here in my arms is where you should be (oh here in my arms) (it wasn't really much at all)
Giving me life and it's everything
