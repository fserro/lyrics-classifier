Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile
As a rock and roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well he can tell you that he tried
I could make a transformation as a rock and roll star

So inviting, so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation
As a rock and roll star

Get it on yeah

(Ooh yeah)

I could do with the money (you know that I)
I'm so wiped out with things as they are (you know that I)
I'd send my photograph to my honey 
And I'd come on like a regular superstar

I could make a transformation
As a rock and roll star

So inviting, so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation
As a rock and roll star, get it on yeah

I could do with the money (you know that I)
I'm so wiped out with things as they are (you know that I)
I'd send my photograph to my honey 
And I'd come on like a regular superstar

I could fall asleep at night
As a rock and roll star
I could fall in love all right
As a rock and roll star

Rock and roll star
Rock and roll star
Just watch me now
