When we were out
On the beach that night
The sun was gone
And the tide was high
And as the wind picked up you softly said
You've made a big mistake

These weeks have been
Everything to me
I'm a fool for her
She looks to see
Darling why pick me?
I'm not made for love
You're not made for love

Well, you made a big mistake

You made a big mistake

Now when I think of all
The things I shared?
Love must have got the best of me
'cause I fell in my place
When I'm awake you said
You made a big mistake

3 weeks that mean
Everything to me
Just flew by for her
She speaks down to me
Darling what you think
I'm not made for love
