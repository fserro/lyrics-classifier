I met her in the skate park
She was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen
I acted a fool
But introduced her to some cool music
At least that's the way it seemed to me

And after the drums and bass night
I never heard from her again
I guess it just wasn't meant to be

Ten years later
I was near Old Street
And a stranger ran right up to me
He said
You loved my sister
And I loved your mixtape
So let's have a drink mate
I loved your mixtape

I loved your mixtape
I loved your mixtape
I loved your mixtape
I loved your mixtape
I loved your mixtape
I loved your mixtape
I loved your mixtape
I loved your mixtape
