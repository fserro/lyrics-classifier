You chose to fade away with him
I chose to try and let you in
You chose to fade away with him
I chose to try and let you in

Black is and black ain't
Black is blue and black is red
And black is tan (black will get ya)
And black is light (and black will leave you alone)

Black can get you over
And black can set you down
Black can let you move forward
And black will make you stumble around (black is so hot)
