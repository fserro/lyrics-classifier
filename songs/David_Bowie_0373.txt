I'm just a rock star stabbing away
I'll take the 
I'll take the lead
For another day
A modern scholar 
Just let me know 
If I sing too much
When you're head over heels and the magic is there but 
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
And when the police
Take me away
Impossible
Impossible
It wasn't you 
It was Mothers' Day

Let's get this show on the road
Let's get Atomica
Let's rock till we explode
Let's get Atomica
Babe

Protect you from the voices
Protect from the visions
Protect you from the silence 
For another day
These modern people 
They sure know how to live
When you're head over heels and the magic is gone it's 
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Then we shall swim in that
Covered up pool
Impossible
Impossible
By the white trees dressed 
In purple tuelle

Let's get this show on the road
Let's get Atomica
Let's rock till we explode
Let's get Atomica
Babe

I hold myself 
Like a god
Like a god
Babe

I'm just a pop star chopping away
I'll take the the 
I leave the sins for another day
A little puny
Just let me know
If I talk too much
When you're head over heels and the magic is there but
Impossible
Impossible
Impossible
Then we should swim in that
Covered up pool
Impossible
Impossible
By the white trees dressed 
In purple tuelle

Let's get this show on the road
Let's get Atomica
Let's rock till we explode
Let's get Atomica
Babe
