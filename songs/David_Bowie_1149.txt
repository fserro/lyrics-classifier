Rubber band
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand

Rubber band
In 1910 I was so handsome and so strong
My mustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long
And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes

Dear rubber band, you're playing my tune out of tune
Oh

Rubber band
Wont you play a haunting theme again to me
While I eat my scones and drink my cup of tea
The sun is warm but its a lonely afternoon

Oh, play that theme

Rubber band
How I wish that I could join your rubber band
We could play in lively parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon, Id find my love

Rubber band,
In the 14-18 war I went to sea
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me
And now shes married to the leader of the band, oh

Oh yeah, I hope you break your baton
