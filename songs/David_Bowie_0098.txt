Eddie boy lit like paraffin 
Spending two weeks
In a crack house
Burns on his brain 
Like Chernobyl

Dean was seen 
With a two bag purchase
He was lying dead on his mother's bed
Someone for pray for-
Till I met you

Life is like a broken arrow-
Memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune-
I can make you happy
Every day of your life
Making my love 
Like a shining star
Takin' my love just a touch too far

Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice 
Cause love left holes
And four swell kids breaking her heart
I've got windows, I've seen much vice, 
I've touched down with vermin,
Cowardice, lice,
And I say

Nobody cares what you do-
Please be yourself to death

I could be your great misfortune
But you'll never find a, bet you'll never find a better man.

Making my love 
Like a shining star
Taking my love just a touch too far.

Peter met Frank 
Formed a dummy run gang
Worked heist or hit for 10 g's flat
Blew heads outta shape for the name of Trotsky, Sinn-
Fein, Hitler cashdown
No hope heroes cover the page 
With debts in hell
And fingers in blood
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs 
Threw it all away
Another life in the grave
Another life in the grave

Life is like a broken arrow-
Memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune-
Well I could make you happy 
Every goddamn single day of your life

Making my love
Like a shining star
Like a shining star
Baby that's what you are
Like a shining star

Making my love
Like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too far
