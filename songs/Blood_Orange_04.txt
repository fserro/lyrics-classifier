I'm like, it was like
It was too late, it was late

I saw, oh, I see
Nothing that is confident to me
Repeat (repeat) and discreet (discreet)
Feelings that are not supposed to be
Ooh

Open the door, leave me with arms exposed, oh
Outside, I saw where I belong

What's worse? Ego?
Thinking that it's something that you're owed
2 AM, it's not like it was
Listen to the fears that you hear now, oh yeah

Open the door, leave me with arms exposed, oh
Outside, I saw where I belong
Ooh
