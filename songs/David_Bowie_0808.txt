Grown inside a plastic box
Micro thoughts and safety locks
Hearts become outdated clocks
Tickin' in your mind

Now it's time to close our eyes
(Ahh)
Now it's time to say goodbye
(Ahh)
Now it's time to face the lie
(Ahh)
That we'd never cry

What's really happening?
(Ya, ya)
What tore us apart?
(Ya, ya)
What's really happening?
(Ya, ya)
(Ya, ya)

What's really happening?
(Ya, ya)
What tore us apart?
(Ya, ya)
What's really happening?
(Ya, ya)
(Ya, ya)
(Ya, ya)

All the clouds are made of glass
And they're slowly sinking
Falling like the shattered past
Were we built to last?

What's really happening?
(Ya, ya)
What tore us apart?
(Ya, ya)
What's really happening?
(Ya, ya)
(Ya, ya)

What's really happening?
(Ya, ya)
What tore us apart?
(Ya, ya)
What's really happening?
(Ya, ya)
(Ya, ya)
(Ya, ya)

Now it's time to close our eyes
Now it's time to say goodbye
(Ooa)
Now it's time to face the lie
(Ooa)
That we'd never cry

What's really happening?
(Ya, ya)
What tore us apart?
(Ya, ya)
What's really happening?
(Ya, ya)
(Ya, ya)
(Ya, ya)
(Ya, ya)
