She's sparkling, like a fresh glass of Perrier
She's happy like my birthday
My birthday, oui tout Ã  fait

She's like a dream
Salted caramel ice cream

She's bubbling, like the water in my kettle
She's the sting in a nettle
The drummer in my metal band

She's like a dream
Salted caramel ice cream

Oh, god, she's coming
Don't look up
I've got to do this
I've got to do it right
I've got to do it right

She's glistening
Like a fresh minted quarter
She's the squash in my water
She's so posh may I court her, ma'am

She's like a dream
Salted caramel ice cream

Oh, god, she's coming
Don't look up
I've got to do this
I've got to do it right
I've got to do it right
I've got to do it right
I've got to do it right
