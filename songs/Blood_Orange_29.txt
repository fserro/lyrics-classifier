Later because of the fact that we're waiting for the working girls to get there
(And what is it those girls are doing?)
 Well, they're making money for the balls, or they're making their costumes
Their outfits, or you know getting, getting it together like that
(What is their profession?) something like that
At times they do expect sexual favors, but that is between myself and them
So I do not wish to further speak about that
If they do, but at most times ninety-nine percent of the time they don't
Ninety-five percent of the time they don't

Dance 'cause it's your thing
Say that you got time for two
This is me in New York
(Desirée)

Is anyone your friend?
Or lovers that turn up at two
I cannot stay in New York
(Desirée)

Can you really think it's fine or cool when you're still on your go?
Maybe it's a chance for me to go and finally be alone
Can you really think it's fine or cool when you're still on your go?
Maybe it's a chance for me to go and finally be alone

If you marry a woman in the suburbs
A regular woman is married to her husband
And she wants him to buy her a washer and dryer set
In order for him to buy that, I'm sure she'd have to 
Go bed with him anyway to give him what he wants
For her to get what she wants
So in the long run, it all ends up the same way
