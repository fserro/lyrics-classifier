Lately, I've been going crazy
Thinking of the time we had our first baby
My baby, you're my baby
Sitting on the sofa, watching the TV
Waiting for the sun to come up
While I'm feeding our baby, yeah, our baby

And even though you must be close, I can hardly see you
(Be close)
I'm in paradise, yeah, I'm in paradise
With you

Lately, I've been feeling uneasy, but you pick me up
When you hug and you squeeze me, my baby
You're my baby
Sitting on the plane and playing on Mario
I can't explain how it feels to be far from you, my baby
Makes me crazy

And even though you must be close, I can hardly see you
(Be close)
I'm in paradise, yeah, I'm in paradise
With you

Lately, I've been going spare
