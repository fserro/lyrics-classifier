I got to see you made it for more
You said it before
You wish I'd seen the saint you were before
Your skin's a flag that shines for us all
You said it before
The brown that shines and lights your darkest thoughts

Ay
I had to see you live for more
You said it before, uh huh
You wish I'd seen the saint you were before
Your skin's a flag that shines for us all
You said it before
The brown that shines and lights your darkest thoughts
Oh, ay

Your skin's a flag that shines for us all
You said it before, mmm
The brown that shines and lights your darkest thoughts
Uh

Spreading all the love for you
You never tell me all that you do
Quiet when it's done
Will you ever run?
Spreading all the love for you
You never tell me all that you do
Quiet when it's done
Will you ever run?
Quiet when it's done
Will you ever run?

I got to see you live for more
You said it before
You wish I'd seen the saint you were before
