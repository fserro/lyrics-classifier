Oh
Today

Loose touch and confidence never seems the same
Eyesight stays clearer when selfishness became
Number one and chewing gum, you were afraid
Big mistake in stepping out, nothing good today
Loose touch and confidence never seems the same
Eyesight stays clearer when selfishness became
Number one and chewing gum, you were afraid
Big mistake in stepping out, nothing good today (today)

Oh, today
Today
Today (today)
