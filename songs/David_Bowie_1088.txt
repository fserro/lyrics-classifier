Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Images of broken light 
Which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Sounds of laughter, shades of life
Are ringing through my opened ears 
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love
Which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing is gonna
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing is gonna
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change 
Nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna change 
Nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna change 
Nothing's gonna change

Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change 
Nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna change, no, no, no
Nothing's gonna change my world
