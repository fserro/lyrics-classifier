Hope little girl
Come blow me away
I don't care much
I win anyway
Just a dog

I'm goddamn rich
An exploding man
When I talk in the night
There's oil in my hands
Just a dog

Fall dogs are cruel and smart
Smart time breaks your heart
Fall dog bombs the moon
Devil in your marketplace
A devil in your bleeding face
Fall dog bombs the moon
What a dog

There's always a moron
Someone to hate
A corporate tie
A wig and a date
Just a dog

These blackest of years
That have no sound
No shape, no depth
No underground
Just a dog

Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks your heart
Fall dog bombs the moon
A devil in your marketplace
A devil in your bleeding face
Fall dog bombs the moon
What a dog

Thank you
Thanks very much
