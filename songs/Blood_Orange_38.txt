Deep in the play
I see you as you are looking over
Friends in my way
You never could have been a good lover
Watch what you say
Could never mean a word and still hurt you
Look the other way
Please tell me that I am wrong
So wrong

I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough

Forty-nine days
Surely I should be feeling a whole lot better
Ways and ways
You keep on coming back
I keep letting you in

I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough

I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough

I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough

I never was in love
You know that you were never good enough
Fall asleep right next to me
You know that you were never good enough
