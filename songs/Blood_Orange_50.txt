Baby Love
Would you like to be my little girl, for life?
Take you on a cruise in my sweet Cadillac
Promised your papa to bring you home by nine
His watch, not mine

Oh my baby
Makes me oh so happy just to hear my name
Rumors in my school hall make me so ashamed
Want to be just like the other girls tonight
Just for tonight

Are you cold?
Take my leather jacket as I turn this on
Fleetwood serenade you into my sweet arms
Never seemed to care about most other girls
You're not other girls

Oh my babe
Whiskey town is ours just for tonight

So please
Forget everything that my daddy said to me
I know it's not your fault but I am not to blame
Just say my name
