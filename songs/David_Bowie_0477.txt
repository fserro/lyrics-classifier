VERSE (there)
  Was she never there/here?
  Was she ever?
  Was it air she breathed?

  At the wrong time
  Oh-oh
  Oh-oh

All the flowers so
From the gallery
With the hymns of night
Singing "Come to Me"

CHORUS
  At the wrong time
  On the wrong day
  All the lights are fading now
  If I'm dreaming all my life (x2 second time)

Just one living chance
When the mother sighs
When the father steps aside
At the wrong time
Oh-oh

VERSE (here)

CHORUS

Was she ever?
Was she ever here?
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life away

Dreaming my life
Dreaming my
Dreaming my
Dreaming my
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my life away
Oh-oh

REPEAT
  Dreaming my life
  Dreaming my 
  Dreaming my life away
  Oh-oh
