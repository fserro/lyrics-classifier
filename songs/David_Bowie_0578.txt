There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes
I'm not trying to lose control
But you're just pushin', pushin', pushin' for a fight

You look trapped, turn the radio on
Too much smoke, air conditioning gone
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking, looking, looking for a break

Is it love or is it what?
Who's this guy I'm gonna blow away, hey
What kind of love is he giving you?
I'm a dizzy's, what I'm trying to say

I said, too dizzy you can't have a lover
I'm too dizzy, it's me or no other
I'm a bad loser, I'm a shakin' in anger
I'm a too dizzy, you can't have no lover

You can go on dreaming every night
But I'm not letting you out of my sight
I'm a ten times the man than any guy around
But you're just itchin', twitchin', itchin' for a break

There's too much talking for a night drive
And too much mist in front of my eyes
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking, looking, looking for a break

Is it love or is it what?
Who's this guy I'm gonna blow away
What kind of love is he giving you?
I'm a dizzy's, what I'm trying to say

I said, too dizzy you can't have a lover
I'm too dizzy, it's me or no other
I'm a bad loser, I'm a shakin' in anger
I said I'm a too dizzy, you can't have no lover

I said too dizzy, don't come any harder
I said I'm too dizzy, don't come any closer
I said I'm too dizzy
I said too dizzy, too dizzy, too dizzy

Too dizzy, you can't have no lover
Too dizzy, I'm too dizzy
I'm too dizzy
