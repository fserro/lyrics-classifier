Shine shine shine (x6)

Bleeds like a craze, Dad
These are the craze

Easy come, come, gotta back
In the valley of the dead man walks
How they drank from the jazz

Astral, Kestrel, 
Fed into the featherfall
Fed him on a pencil carving 
You will never get

Shine shine shine
Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the craze
Shine shine shine
Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the craze

Seek for a leather journey
Never stopped to think about
Hollywood King Kong
Domino on the side

Street light, looking right
Looking to the parlous parlors
Party on the dead
Put a net through his headache

Shine shine shine (x3)

Blee-eed, bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the craze

Living on a movie
All the Shirley/Charley films on film
Come together, party
Footnote on the footstone

Shine shine shine
Bleeds like a craze, Dad
These are the craze

Shine shine shine
Shine shine shine

CHORUS (x6)

Bleed like a craze, Dad
These are the craze
