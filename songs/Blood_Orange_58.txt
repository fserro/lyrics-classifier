Ay

Demons on my neck, neck
Summer take a toll
Glam in my eye shine bright on my soul
Girls awful wet slip, fall, break the pain
And the same anxiety's coming up again
I've been losing out on something
So I'm told by my friends

Runnin' in circles
Looking for something to hold on
Runnin' in circles
Knowing there's nowhere to go
And it's harder to be on your own (so hard)
And it's hard when the night owns your soul
And it's harder to think on your own
You're runnin' on my mind
Yeah, you're runnin' on my mind
And the summer is taking it all (I know you're runnin' on my mind)
Runnin' on my mind
It all
You brought it to me, you got it all
Yeah, you're runnin' on my mind
It all

Demons on my neck, neck
Summer take a toll
Glam in my eye shine bright on my soul
Girls awful wet slip, fall, break the pain
And the same anxiety's coming up again

You and your soul are never not one
I said, you and yourself are never not one
Whoa, rise and shine
Rise and shine
'Cause you and your soul are never not one

Hold on, yes
You gonna be okay, you gonna be okay
Everybody goes through it
Everybody goes through it
You're gonna be all right
Just hold on to your mighty way of being

Live for the floor
If I called you would you answer me?

So, you were, like, talking about this idea of being called upon
And for some reason the first thing I heard was, like this
Faint, irritating, incessant buzzer
And I think I heard it three times in my life
The first was, was within myself
Um, to stop pretending
To stop performing in ways that people wanted me to
To actually show up for myself
And to be myself
