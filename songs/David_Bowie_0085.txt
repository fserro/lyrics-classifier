Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

You've arrived in the land of a thousand different names
And the fabulous sons have crashed their planes in flames
Now tomorrow is back claiming redemption is on your heels
And a toothless past is asking you how it feels

And me, my little red Corvette has driven by
Fair weather heart has fallen in
My rainyday girl is feeling down
And she tells me that the world is spinning round

I say the dream was all for you
You're nobody else
Tonight the zeroes were singing for you
Yeah

Yeah
Oh yeah
Hi, can I walk you home again today?
Gotta get forgive and forget hey hey
Something good is happening and I don't know what it is
Don't you know we're back on trial again today

And it's breaking wine for you
Hell, it's only 'cause you're true
Someone outtimed my heart
Stopping and preaching and letting love in

You are my moon, you are my sun
Heaven knows what you are
Tonight the zeroes are singing for you
Yes, they were

Tonight the zeroes were singing for you
You
Tonight the zeroes were singing for you

It doesn't matter what you try to do
(Ah ah aha)
(Ah ah aha)
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
Doesn't matter what you try to do
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
Doesn't matter where you try to go
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
Doesn't matter who we really are
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)

It really doesn't matter
Doesn't matter
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
Doesn't matter
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
(Doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
