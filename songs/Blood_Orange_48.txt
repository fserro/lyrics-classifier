No, you should do it

Oh
Oh

Time will tell if you can figure this and work it out
No one's waiting for you anyway, so don't be stressed now
Even if it's something that you've kept your eye on
It is what it is
Time will tell if you can figure this and work it out
No one's waiting for you anyway, don't be stressed now
Even if it's something that you've kept your eye on
It is what it is

(And it keeps on running back)
Finishing 8 or 9, tell me it's the perfect time
Oh, oh
(And it keeps on running back)
Told you I'll be waiting, hiding from the rainfall
Yeah
(And it keeps on running back)
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
(And it keeps on running back)
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
(And it keeps on running back)
(And it keeps on running)

Time will tell if you can figure this and work it out
No one's waiting for you anyway, so don't be stressed now
Even if it's something that you've kept your eye on
It is what it is
(And it keeps on running back)
Even if it's all you know just keep your heart in
Anyway to keep it up just never let yourself down
(And it keeps on running back)
Even if it's something that you've kept your eye on
It is what it is

(And it keeps on running back)
Oh, oh
(And it keeps on running back)
(And it keeps on running back)

Finishing 8 or 9
Tell me it's the perfect time
Oh, oh
(And it keeps on running back)
Told you I'll be waiting, hiding from the rainfall
Yeah

Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
I got it open
Come into my bedroom
Come into my bedroom
Yeah

(And it keeps on running back)
(And it keeps on running back)
(And it keeps on running back)
Time will tell (and it keeps on running back)
Time will tell
Time will tell
It keeps on running back
Time will tell
Time will tell (and it keeps on running back)
Time will tell
(It keeps on running back)
(And it keeps on running)
