Oh my, naked eyes
I should have kept you, I should have tried
I should of been more wiser kind of guy
I miss you

Give me wings, give me space
Give me money for a change of face
There's noisy rooms and passion pants
I loved you

Where's the morning in my life?
Where's the sense in staying right? Who said time is on my side?
I've got ears and eyes and nothing in my life
But I survive your naked eyes, I'll survive

You alone across the floor, you and me and nothing more
You're the great mistake I never made
I never lied to you, I hate it when you lied
Then I'll survive your naked eyes, I'll survive

People boys all snowy white
Razzle dazzle clubs every night
Wished I'd sent a Valentine
I loved you

I'll survive naked eyes, I'll survive
I'll survive my naked eyes, I'll survive
I'll survive, naked eyes, I'll survive
I'll survive, I'll survive
