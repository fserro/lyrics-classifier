Do you ever try and face yourself, goodnight
Or is it easier with your friend?
Pretend your friend's enough to end
You were just another loud mouth cute faced girl
Could you press skin, take your lover the world
You're not the only one in the world
You choose to see me, even with all this glee

Are you okay?
What's in your way?

Are you sleeping with the lights on baby?
(Hands up, get up, hands up, get up)
Keep your hood off when you're walking 'cause they
(Hands up, get up, hands up, get up)
Trying not to be obsessed with your heyday
(Hands up, get up, hands up, get up)
Sure enough they're gonna take your body
(Hands up, get up, hands up, get up)

Don't shoot!

Something never been done before
Than it's no replacement for it
When there is a replacement for something
It will always
