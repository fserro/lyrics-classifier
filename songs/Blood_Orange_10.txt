Take it or leave it, it's what you're owed
Not okay, uh
He could make you think you're someone else
Headaches, always, always, uh
Something to hold onto
While you change all you do for a place
Uh, yeah, uh
Take it or leave it, it's what you're owed
Not okay, uh, uh, uh

Choose to ignore blues
Something to get in your way, uh
You choose to stay (you choose to stay)
You choose to stay (oh)

Nauseas, feeling so weak
Can't smoke if I do not eat
Knees weak at 33
Late nights, but don't text me
Swallow, but want to scream
I want the lifestyle for free

Choose to ignore blues
Something to get in your way, uh
You choose to stay (you choose to stay)
You choose to stay (you choose to stay)
You choose to stay (oh)

I want the lifestyle for free
I want pussy for free
An arm around me to grieve
Asleep without sweat on me
My self doubts in a tweet
My mood rests on coffee
Try to understand me
Try to understand me
Nauseas, feeling so weak
Can't smoke if I do not eat
Knees weak at 33
Late nights, but don't text me
Swallow, but want to scream
I want the lifestyle for free
