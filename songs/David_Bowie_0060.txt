If there is something
That I might find
Look around corners
Try to find peace of mind

I say wherever you go
If you leave
Tryin' to keep a straight course is not easy

Something is special
Looking at me
Some kind of reaction
When it comes down to me

Look around baby
Too easy to say
When this earth is just a game

I would do anything for you
I would come all day
I would swim all the oceans blue
I would a thousand miles
Driven by secrets
More than enough for me to share

I would put roses around the door
Sit in the garden
Growin' the day holds by the score

She could ask I will give bold detail
Takes me right back (when you were young)
From your past and skip into the air
Watch them fall down (when you were young)

Your love
I feel you around me all the time
You used to fall apart (when you were young)
Your love
I feel you put them all around
The hills were higher (when you were young)
Your love
I feel you put them all around
The trees were taller (when you were young)
Your love
I feel you put them all around
The grass was greener (when you were young)
Your love
I feel you put them all around
This road (when you were young)
