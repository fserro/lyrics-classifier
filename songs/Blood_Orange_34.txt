Ninety-nine percent, I know you're not fine
Now everyone could be mistakenly kind
Niggas in the back tryna act blind
Several ways to think about your eyesight

Say what you will, what you want
Know it's not the time that you can
Receiving a gift of change with a kiss
Not too long and not too bored and can't resist or miss
The chance of being who they think, they think you are
How long before your journey?
Walls inside of me that then tell me to breathe
They shake your hand and thank the man for just letting it be
Know my worth and fake the blame
But I know she's better than me
Wait your turn and change your ways
But I know he's better than me
Why choose love when hate comes first?
And I know they're better than me
Wait your turn and change your ways
But I know he's better than me

Why choose love when hate comes first?

Wait your turn and change your ways
But I know he's better than me

I know he's better than me
And I know and I know and I know
I know he's better than me
