Time is tight, love always gets in the way
I'm sorry
Didn't mean to hurt you but I always do
I'm sorry
Well my eyes are pinned and money's spent
I'm sorry
I wouldn't do for me what I would do for you
I'm sorry
I guess I've thrown it away
Thrown it away
Didn't mean to do it that way
I'm sorry
Time is so tight and I mean it if I say
I'm sorry
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry
