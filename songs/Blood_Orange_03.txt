Nothing lasts forever, and I told you
Everything you need to know that's not true
Lyin' to myself because it hurts you
Waitin' for the simple chance to come through
I've been known to hide within my own walls
Jewelry in my ice so that I don't fall
Onto higher prices, and escape with
All my ice intact, and who am I to kid?
Pound of flesh, and yeah, I'm still kickin'
(What? See) but now I'm stupid
Fears because the past and future scare me
Ridin' out to Venice with a nosebleed
I stood before the waves and prayed to be clean
But dirty in my mind, I don't turn green, uh
This is everything you ever wanted
Cryin' for the ones I lost in '18
IG3, 2-0-1-4, unhappy
Nothing ever makes you get past it
Thirty-three and stuck stop thinkin'
Fine with this and I keep on spendin', uh
Shower my beliefs with ice melting

Losin' touch of everything I know
Prayin' for my heart to turn to stone
Bandana tied around my broken skull
Ice around my wrist, my touch is cold
Losin' touch of everything I know
Prayin' for my heart to turn to stone
Bandana tied around my broken skull
Ice around my wrist, my touch is cold

Don't be actin' dumb, cookie's gonna crumble
Wipin' up the crumbs, I do this shit casual
Happens all the time, plus I'm dark and handsome
Shit broken by design, it's a tantrum

Losin' touch of everything I know
Prayin' for my heart to turn to stone
Bandana tied around my broken skull
Ice around my wrist, my touch is cold

(Don't be actin' dumb, cookie's gonna crumble)
(Wipin' up the crumbs, I do this shit casual)
(Happens all the time, plus I'm dark and handsome)
