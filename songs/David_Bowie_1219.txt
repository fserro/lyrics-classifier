Mother, you had me
But I never had you
I, I wanted you
But you didn't want me
So I, mmhmm
I just gotta tell you
Goodbye
Goodbye

Father, you left me
But I never left you
I, I needed you
You didn't need me
So I 
I've just got to tell
Goodbye
Goodbye

Mama don't go
Daddy come home
Mama don't go

Children, please don't do
What I have done, no, no
I, I couldn't walk
But I tried to run
So I, I 
I gotta tell ya
Goodbye
Goodbye
