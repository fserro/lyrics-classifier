Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playin' on the radio
Let's sway
While color lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run
I'll run with you
If you say hide
We'll hide
Because my love for you
Would tear my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance
Let's dance
For fear your grace should fall
Let's dance
For fear tonight is all

If you say run
I'll run with you
And if you say hide
We'll hide
Because my love for you
Would tear my heart in two
If you should fall into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance
You could look into my eyes
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's sway
Let's sway
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Under the moonlight
Let's dance
Under the moonlight
This serious moonlight

Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's dance
Let's sway

Let's sway
Let's sway
Let's sway
Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playing on the radio
Let's sway
While the color lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space
Let's dance
Fear that your grace should fall
Let's dance
For fear tonight is all, is all, is all, is all
Let's dance

Yeah, not really
That's, that's it
That's, that's it
Got it haha
Got it
