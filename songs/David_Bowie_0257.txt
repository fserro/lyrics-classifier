Cheena so sound, so titty up this malchick, say
Party up mood, naddy vellocet round on Tuesday
Real bad dizzy snatch making all the homies mad, Thursday
Popo blind to the polly in the hole by Friday

Where the f*ck did Monday go?
I'll go to this pig and pug show
I'm sitting in the chestnut tree
Who the f*ck's gonna mess with me?

Girl loves me
(Hey cheena)
Girl loves me
Girl loves me
(Hey cheena)
Girl don't see

Where the f*ck did Monday go?
I'll go to this pig and pug show
Where the f*ck did Monday go?

You viddy at the Cheena
Choodesny with the red rot
Libbilubbing litso-fitso
Devotchka watch her garbles
Spatchko at the rozz-shop
Split a ded from his deng deng
Viddy viddy at the cheena

Girl loves me
(Hey cheena)
Girl loves me
Girl loves me
(Hey cheena)
Girl told me
Girl loves me
(Hey cheena)
Girl loves me

Where the f*ck did Monday go?
Where the f*ck did Monday go?
Where the f*ck did Monday go?

Girl loves me
Girl loves me
