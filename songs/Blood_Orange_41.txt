You won't hear my name
I can't watch you throw it all away
Away
You are playing games
I'm done trying to help you run down, escape
Escape

But you look away
And I look to you
That's where we are
And what we saw was you
On your own
And I'm on my own
And we were wrong
There's no right thing

(Oh) I've been (I've been)
You've been my everything
And I've seen your worst, baby
This is what it comes to
Knowing we're broken

I've been changing my whole scene
You need somebody different
This is where we got to
Knowing that you're the wrong thing

But you look away
And I look to you
That's where we are
And what we saw was you
On your own
And I'm on my own
And we were wrong
There's no right thing

But you can't see me, when you're pushing me away
You can't see me, when you're pushing me away
I'm the one who sees you, I'm the one who needs you
Mm (oh whoa whoa)
You can't see me, when you're pushing me away (pushing me away)
You can't see me, when you're pushing me away (away)
I'm the one who sees you (I see you, baby)
I'm the one who needs you (I need you, baby)
Mm

But you look away
And I look to you
That's where we are
And what we saw was you
On your own
And I'm on my own
And we were wrong
There's no right thing, oh
